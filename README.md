# Black-jack-Game
This is a simple game made using HTML,CSS and JS.You only win if you get sum of cards picked is equal to 21.And at times when sum is 21 or greater than 21,the new card button is disabled.
New card button generates a new random number and adds it to the cards array and the sum is also updated.The Ace is equal to 11 and J,Q,K is equal to 10.So the random numbers
generated are from 2 to 11.The project is deployed at: https://phenomenal-arithmetic-93528d.netlify.app
